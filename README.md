# LabSampleMap
A small project to create a map-like sheet with the physical location of our samples.

I wrote a small post about it [here](https://cristian2420.github.io/posts/first_post/), a small side project to help our lab manager in the lab. It was fun to remember and suffer (again) how to code outside of Python and R, and to match what she wanted with what I should give her :sweat_smile:.
